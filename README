This is an alternative loader for the U3 Switchblade project.
The standard loader uses a VBScript, which is easily disabled and detected.
There are some other loaders, but they show a black screen or require special methods to make them silent.
This loader is made in C, and will run silent out-of-the-box. It will not show a black window, and it will not run any scriptservers.

If you're looking for a package with this loader and the Launchpad program, go to:

and the go to the 'Downloads' page.

If you're looking for the sourcecode and want to contribute, you're at the right place.
The project was made with Dev-Cpp, and the main.c should be quite self-explanatory.
