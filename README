This is an alternative loader for the U3 Switchblade project.
The standard loader uses a VBScript, which is easily disabled and detected.
There are some other loaders, but they show a black screen or require special methods to make them silent.
This loader is made in C, and will run silent out-of-the-box. It will not show a black window, and it will not run any scriptservers.

If you're looking for a package with this loader and the Launchpad program, go to:
http://wiki.hak5.org/wiki/Switchblade_Packages 
and look under "Alternative Loaders".
Look for the one made by krisje8 (me).

If you're looking for the sourcecode and want to contribute, you're at the right place.
The project was made with Dev-Cpp, and the main.c should be quite self-explanatory.
